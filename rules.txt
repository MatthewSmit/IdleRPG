Combat:
dodge = agility + level
hit chance = dexterity

Miss chance (based off skills + agility, some spells can bypass)

    10 attack with 10 dodge = 50% hit chance
    10 attack with 20 dodge = 25% hit chance
    20 attack with 10 dodge = 75% hit chance

    attack < dodge  = -0.5(-1/(dodge/attack))
    attack >= dodge = 0.5(-1/(attack/dodge))+1

Armour (reduced damage, really high armour can reduce to 0, only reduces physical)
    damage - armour = real damage

Resistance (reduced damage/effect duration, only reduces magical)
